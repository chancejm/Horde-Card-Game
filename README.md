# Horde Card Game
HORDE CARD GAME.

This game puts you up agaisnt an endless amount of monsters that become increasingly more powerful as the game goes on.

You fight these monsters with "5" heros, (Knight, Wizard, Ranger, Paladin, Assassin).

Each hero can do different things for either themselves or thier allies depending on their attack position.

There are three attack Positions (so obviously you can only pick 3 heros per attack).

Attack postions are "LEFT" "CENTER" "RIGHT".
SEE "INFO" IN GAME FOR MORE SPECIFIC DATA ON WHAT EACH HERO DOES IN EACH POSITION.

This was inspired by Magic the Gathering TCG and a Tower Defence style game "Legioin TD".
